Reduced Spectra and Source Data for
“Subgiants in NGC 188 Reveal that Rotationally Induced Mixing Creates the Main Sequence Li-Dip”

This repository contains the reduced spectra and source data files used to produce the figures in the above study.

Data for Figure 1
Cummings17_Hyades.dat.txt and Cummings17_Praesepe.dat.txt: Source data for plotting Hyades and Praesepe stars.

Hyades_2.txt and Pleiades.txt: Source data for plotting the model lines.

plot_B18_SM.txt and plot_M07.txt: Source data for plotting Pleiades data points.

Data for Figures 2 and 3
Table1.xlsx, Supplementary Data 1.xlsx: Contain the source data to generate Figures 2 and 3.

Supplementary Data 2.xlsx: Contains the individual-night radial velocities for NGC 188 stars, used to evaluate cluster membership and identify binary/single stars.

MESA data files
Including Standard-history.data, Diffusion-history.data, Massloss-history.data, Rotation-29kms-history.data.
Generated using the MESA code, these files include four stellar models: standard, diffusion, mass loss, and rotational mixing. They also serve as the source data for Figure 2.

Reduced Spectra
star1002.fits, star1014.fits, star1015.fits, ..., star909.fits, star97.fits, star99.fits: Reduced 1D spectra for all stars analyzed in this study. These files represent the original observational data.
Users can derive stellar atmospheric parameters and lithium abundances from these spectra using the methods described in the paper.
